Subject: Validation of RDC URLs with Candescent Team

Hi Jose,

Hari has requested us to validate our Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) URLs with the Candescent Team. Below is our URL mapping for RDC:

Candescent URL	Method	Arvest URL	Sample URL
/v6/deposit	POST	<<arvesthost>>/<<env>>/d3-transactions/v1/checks/deposits/remote	https://api-test.arvest.com/test/d3-transactions/v1/checks/deposits/remote
Could you please confirm if our URLs align with the agreed standards?

Thank you,
Santosh
